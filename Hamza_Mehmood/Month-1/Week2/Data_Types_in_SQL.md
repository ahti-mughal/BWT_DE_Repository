# Data Types in SQL
In SQL, `data types` are used to define the type of data that can be stored in a `column` or a `variable.` The following are some commonly used data types in SQL:

## INT
It is used to store `whole numbers.` For example, `age,` `number of products sold,` etc.

## VARCHAR 
It is used to store `alphanumeric characters.` For example, name, address, email, etc.

## DATE
It is used to store `date values.` For example, the date of a transaction.

## FLOAT
It is used to store `floating-point` numbers. For example, the price of a product.

## BOOLEAN 
It is used to store `true or false` values. For example, the status of an order.

## CHAR 
It is used to store `fixed-length` character strings. For example, storing a `code of fixed length.`

## DECIMAL
It is used to store fixed-point decimal numbers. For example, storing financial data like currency values.

## BLOB 
It is used to store binary data. For example, storing images, videos, or other multimedia files.

These are just a `few examples` of data types in SQL. It's essential to choose the appropriate data type to optimize storage space and ensure data accuracy.

### Here's an example code to create a table with some of the data types mentioned above in SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    hire_date DATE,
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    is_active BOOLEAN
);
```
## Explanation

In this code, we have created a table called `"employees"` with `columns` for `"id" (integer),` `"name" (varchar),` `"age" (integer),` `"hire_date" (date),` `"salary" (decimal),` and `"is_active" (boolean).`

Note that the `"VARCHAR"` data type takes a `parameter` to specify the `maximum length` of the string that can be stored in that column. The `"DECIMAL"` data type takes two parameters to specify the `maximum total digits` and `maximum digits after the decimal point.`

You can also use other data types like `"FLOAT",` `"CHAR",` `"BLOB",` etc. as per your `requirements.`
