Example:

SELECT Categories.CategoryName, Suppliers.CompanyName
FROM Categories
CROSS JOIN Suppliers;

We have two tables in a database called "Northwind" - Categories and Suppliers.

The Categories table contains information about different product categories. 
Each row in the Categories table represents a unique product category and has information such as 
the category ID, category name, and a description of the category.

The Suppliers table contains information about the suppliers of the products in the Categories table. 
Each row in the Suppliers table represents a unique supplier and has information such as 
the supplier ID, supplier name, and contact information.

Now, we want to generate a report that shows all possible combinations of Categories and Suppliers.
In other words, we want to see a report that lists all the product categories and their corresponding suppliers, 
even if a supplier does not supply any products in a particular category.

To achieve this, we can use a cross join between the Categories and Suppliers tables, which will generate a result set that contains all possible combinations of rows from both tables. 
We can then use this result set to create the report that shows all the product categories and their corresponding suppliers.
