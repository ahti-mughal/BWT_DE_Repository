LEFT ANTI JOIN:

So far that we work on Joins such as Outer Joins, Full Join, Cross Join, Self Join are additive Joins
that add columns to the original left table.

In these Joins(Anti Joins), Right table determines which records to keep in the left table. They are used similar to WHERE clause
where it depends on the value of second table.

Left Anti Join keeps records of left table that do not match with records in right table.
A left anti join is a type of join in SQL that returns all the rows from the left table that do not have a matching row in the right table, 
while excluding the matching rows from the result. 
In other words, it returns the "unmatched" rows from the left table.
