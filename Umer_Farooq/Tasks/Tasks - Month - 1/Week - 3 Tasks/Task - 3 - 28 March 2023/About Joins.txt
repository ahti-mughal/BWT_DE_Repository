What are Joins:

In a relational database, data is distributed in multiple logical tables. 
To get a complete meaningful set of data, you need to query data from these tables using joins.

In SQL, a join operation combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them into a single table. 
The common column is usally the Primary Key Field as it identifies the column. 
The common columns are typically the Primary Key column in first table and Foriegn Key column in the second table.

Joins are used to extract data from multiple tables in a single query, avoiding the need for 
separate queries and reducing the data retrieval time.

As a Data Engineer, joins are essential for data integration, data cleansing, and data transformation tasks, 
as they enable the consolidation of data from various sources into a single database.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SET OPERATORS OPERATION VS JOINS OPERATION:

Set operators and joins are both used to combine data in SQL, but they operate in different ways and are used in different contexts.

1. 

-- Set operators, such as UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT, work on the rows of two or more tables or queries. 
These operators combine the result sets of the queries vertically, one row at a time. 
The resulting set of rows will have the same number of columns as the queries being combined, 
and the columns will be ordered according to the order in the first query in the set.

-- Joins, on the other hand, work on the columns of two or more tables. 
Joins combine data horizontally across the columns of the tables being joined. 
Joins are used to combine data from different tables based on a common column, and they can be used to join multiple tables together.

The resulting set of columns in a join will depend on the columns being selected in the SELECT statement. 
When using joins, it is important to specify which columns to include in the result set and to specify the join condition, 
which defines how the tables will be joined.

2. Summary:
In summary, set operators combine rows vertically while joins combine data horizontally. 
Set operators do not require common columns, while joins require at least one common column. 
Set operators only operate on one column at a time, while joins can operate on multiple columns at a time.

Set operators are row-based operations, while joins are column-based operations. 
Set operators combine rows vertically, while joins combine columns horizontally.
