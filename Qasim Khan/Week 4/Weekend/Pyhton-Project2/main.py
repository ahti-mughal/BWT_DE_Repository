# This is one of the excellent python projects for beginners. Everyone uses a contact book to save contact details, including name, address, phone number, and even email address. This is a command-line project where you will design a contact book application that users can use to save and find contact details. The application should also allow users to update contact information, delete contacts, and list saved contacts. 



# def contact():
#     name = input("Enter name")
#     number = int (input("Enter number"))
#     adress = input("Enter adress")
#     email_adress = input("Enter email")


# contact()
# print(contact)

# with open ("C:\CWQ PYTHON COURCE\project 3\contact.txt","w") as f:
    # f.write()

contactDetails = { "contact1" : {"name":"qasim"}




}    
print(contactDetails)
