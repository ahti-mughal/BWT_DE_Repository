# TASK
# The provided code stub reads two integers,  and , from STDIN.

# Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b. The second line should contain the result of float division,a / b.

# No rounding or formatting is necessary.


# SOLUTION
a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    print(a // b)
    print(a / b)
