What Is SQL?


Structured Query Language (SQL) refers to a standard programming language utilized to extract, organize, 
manage, and manipulate data stored in relational databases. SQL is thereby referred to as a database 
language that can execute activities on databases that consist of tables made up of rows and columns.



What is DDL?

Data definition language (DDL) describes the portion of SQL that creates, 
alters, and deletes database objects. These database objects include schemas, 
tables, views, sequences, catalogs, indexes, variables, masks, permissions, and aliases.


What is DML?

DML is an abbreviation for Data Manipulation Language. Data Manipulation Language or DML 
represents a collection of programming languages explicitly used to make changes in the 
database, such as: CRUD operations to create, read, update, and delete data. 
Using the INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and Delete commands.


What is DQL?

The full form of DQL is Data Query Language. DQL is a part of the grouping involved in SQL 
(Structures Query Language) sub-languages. The SQL sub languages have four major categories, 
DQL, DDL, DCL, and DML.
