The concept of Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) is a design pattern used 
in data warehousing to handle changes to dimension data over time. 
In a data warehouse, dimensions represent the descriptive attributes 
of the data, such as customer, product, or location.

There are different types of Slowly Changing Dimensions, which define how to handle various types of changes:

SCD Type 1: In this type, the existing dimension data is overwritten with the new data. 
	    There is no historical tracking, and only the latest information is retained. 
	    This approach is useful when the history is not important, and the dimension 
	    data only needs to reflect the current state.
	    Example: Suppose you have a customer dimension table, and a customer changes 
	    their phone number. With SCD Type 1, the existing phone number in the dimension 
	    table would be replaced with the new phone number, and there would be no historical 
	    record of the previous phone number.

SCD Type 2: This type maintains a separate record for each change in the dimension data. 
	    It introduces a new row for each change, along with a surrogate key and valid 
	    time attributes. This way, historical information is preserved, and the 
	    dimension table keeps a complete history of changes over time.
	    Example: Consider a product dimension table, and the price of a product changes over time. 
	    With SCD Type 2, a new row would be inserted for each price change, including the valid 
	    start and end dates. This allows for historical analysis, as you can see the price of 
	    the product at different points in time.

SCD Type 3: Type 3 maintains limited historical information by adding a few additional columns 
	    to the dimension table. It typically includes a small number of attributes that 
	    need to be tracked over time, such as "previous value" or "current value" columns. 
	    This approach is useful when only specific attributes require historical tracking, 
	    and maintaining a full history is not required.
	    Example: Let's say you have a department dimension table, and the department name 
	    changes occasionally. With SCD Type 3, you would have additional columns like "previous 
	    department name" and "current department name" in the dimension table. This way, you can 
	    track the changes in the department names while still keeping a simplified dimension structure.

SCD Type 4: This type uses a separate dimension table, known as a mini-dimension or junk dimension, 
	    to store the changing attributes. It consolidates the changing attributes into a single table, 
	    reducing the complexity of the main dimension table. This approach is suitable when multiple 
	    attributes within a dimension tend to change together.
	    Example: Suppose you have a customer dimension with various attributes like marital status, 
	    education level, and employment status, which tend to change together. With SCD Type 4, you 
	    can create a separate mini-dimension table containing these changing attributes. This helps 
	    in maintaining a clean and compact main customer dimension table.


The choice of SCD type depends on the requirements of the data warehouse and the specific dimension attributes 
that need to be tracked over time. It is essential to select the appropriate SCD type to accurately represent 
the historical changes in the dimension data and support effective analysis and reporting.
